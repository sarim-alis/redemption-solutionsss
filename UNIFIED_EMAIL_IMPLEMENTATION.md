# Unified Email System Implementation

## Problem Statement
Previously, the system sent separate emails for each voucher, which could result in:
- Multiple emails for a single order
- Customer confusion with multiple emails
- Email clutter in customer inbox
- Inconsistent email experience

## Solution: Unified Email System

### **New Approach: Single Email with Multiple Vouchers**

Instead of sending separate emails for each voucher, the system now sends **one comprehensive email** containing all vouchers and gift cards from an order.

## Key Features

### **1. Single Email Per Order**
- One email sent per order, regardless of number of products
- All vouchers and gift cards included in the same email
- Cleaner customer experience

### **2. Dynamic Content Sections**
- **Vouchers Section**: Shows all service vouchers (oil change, brake service, etc.)
- **Gift Cards Section**: Shows all gift cards with balance information
- Sections only appear if relevant vouchers exist

### **3. Unified Template**
- Same header, footer, and styling across all emails
- Consistent branding and user experience
- Responsive design for all devices

## Implementation Details

### **New Files Created:**

#### **1. `app/utils/unifiedEmailTemplate.js`**
- Main unified email template
- Handles both vouchers and gift cards
- Dynamic content generation based on voucher types

#### **2. `app/utils/sendVoucherEmailIfFirstOrder.js`** (Updated)
- Added `sendUnifiedVoucherEmail()` function
- Sends single email with multiple vouchers
- Updates all voucher statuses in database

### **Key Functions:**

#### **`generateUnifiedEmailHTML({ order, vouchers })`**
```javascript
// Generates HTML for unified email
const emailHtml = generateUnifiedEmailHTML({ 
  order: paidOrder, 
  vouchers: newVouchers 
});
```

#### **`sendUnifiedVoucherEmail(order, vouchers)`**
```javascript
// Sends unified email for all vouchers
const result = await sendUnifiedVoucherEmail(paidOrder, newVouchers);
```

## Email Structure

### **Header Section**
- Jiffy Lube logo

- Gift card display with:
  - Gift card code
  - Current balance
  - Jiffy Lube branding

### **Common Sections**

- Billing Information
- Footer with terms

## Example Email Content
